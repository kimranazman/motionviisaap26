## Table Stakes

Features that are required for v2.0 to function. Missing = milestone incomplete.

### Schema & Data Model

| # | Feature | Why Required | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| TS-01 | KeyResult as first-class Prisma model | Core premise of v2.0. Currently KR is `String @db.VarChar(20)` on Initiative -- no metrics, no tracking, no progress. Must become a real entity. | Medium | Fields from Excel: id, objectiveId, description, metricType (Revenue/Count), target, actual, unit, progress, status, owner, deadline, weight, howWeMeasure, notes |
| TS-02 | KeyResult fields: target, actual, unit, metricType | Excel has explicit target/actual/unit per KR (e.g., KR1.1: target=800000, unit=RM, metricType=Revenue; KR1.2: target=3, unit="active partnerships", metricType=Count). Without these, KR is just a label. | Low | Two metricTypes in data: `Revenue` (2 KRs) and `Count` (4 KRs). Use enum. |
| TS-03 | KeyResult progress calculation (actual/target as %) | Every OKR tool computes progress as `(actual / target) * 100`. Excel has `Progress %` column. This is the core metric for the hierarchy view. | Low | Calculated field or virtual -- derive from actual/target. Handle zero-target edge case (return 0% not NaN). |
| TS-04 | KeyResult status field | KRs need status tracking. Excel has "Not Started" status. Standard OKR statuses: NOT_STARTED, ON_TRACK, BEHIND, AT_RISK, ACHIEVED. | Low | See Differentiators D-02 for auto-status derivation. For MVP, manual status is sufficient. |
| TS-05 | KeyResult owner (TeamMember) | Excel assigns each KR to an owner (Khairul for 5/6, Azlan for 1). Needed for accountability display. | Low | Reuse existing `TeamMember` enum. |
| TS-06 | KeyResult deadline (string, e.g., "Q4 2026") | Excel uses flexible deadline strings ("Q3 2026", "Q4 2026"), not exact dates. KRs have quarterly cadence, not day-level. | Low | Use `String @db.VarChar(20)` -- not DateTime. Matches actual data format. |
| TS-07 | KeyResult weight field | For objective progress rollup. Standard OKR pattern: KRs have weights that sum to 1.0 per objective. Without weight, objective progress is just an average (which may be fine for 3 KRs per objective). | Low | `Decimal @db.Decimal(3,2)` -- values like 0.40, 0.30, 0.30. Default equally weighted (1/N). |
| TS-08 | KeyResult howWeMeasure field | Excel has detailed "How We Measure" descriptions per KR (e.g., "Combined signed event contract value in CRM (stage = WON). ~6 contracts averaging RM130K."). Important for clarity. | Low | `String @db.Text` -- long-form measurement criteria. |
| TS-09 | Initiative linked to KeyResult via FK | Replace `keyResult String @db.VarChar(20)` with `keyResultId String` FK. This is the structural change that makes KR first-class. | Medium | Migration must handle: (1) create KeyResult records, (2) link existing initiatives to them, (3) drop old keyResult string column. But since we're wiping and reseeding, this is just a clean schema change. |
| TS-10 | Remove Initiative KPI fields | KPI tracking (kpiLabel, kpiTarget, kpiActual, kpiUnit, kpiManualOverride) moves from Initiative to KeyResult. Initiatives track status and progress, KRs track metrics. | Low | Drop 5 columns from Initiative. Update all UI/API that reads these. Existing KPI progress bar component can be repurposed for KR display. |
| TS-11 | Initiative gains budget field | Excel "Initiatives" sheet has `Budget (RM)` column. Currently Initiative has `resourcesFinancial` which is similar but named differently. | Low | Rename or alias. Excel data: budgets range from RM1,400 to RM60,000. Some null. |
| TS-12 | Initiative gains accountable field | Excel has both `Person In Charge` and `Accountable` columns. Current schema has both (`personInCharge` and `accountable`). Already exists -- just confirm it's populated in seed. | None | Already in schema. Just ensure seed maps correctly. |
| TS-13 | SupportTask model | 30 support tasks in Excel with distinct structure from initiatives. They have: category, task description, supports (KR links), owner, frequency, priority, notes. This is a new entity -- not a variant of Initiative. | Medium | New model. Not a subtype of Initiative. Different fields, different lifecycle, different UI. |
| TS-14 | SupportTask category enum | 4 categories from Excel: `DESIGN_CREATIVE` (11 tasks), `BUSINESS_ADMIN` (11 tasks), `TALENTA_IDEAS` (4 tasks), `OPERATIONS` (4 tasks). | Low | Prisma enum. Fixed set, unlikely to change. |
| TS-15 | SupportTask frequency field | Excel frequencies: "Per proposal", "Per event", "Monthly", "Weekly", "Quarterly", "Per event won", "Per module", "Once + updates", "2x per year", "Per opportunity", "Per deal", "Per project/session", "Ongoing", "As needed", "Until approved", "Per session", "Per partnership", "Per intl engagement", "After each session", "Ad-hoc", "Bi-weekly". | Low | Too many variations for enum. Use `String @db.VarChar(50)` -- store as-is from Excel. |
| TS-16 | SupportTask to KeyResult linkage (many-to-many) | Support tasks support one or more KRs (e.g., "KR1.1, KR1.3" or "All KRs"). Need a join table `_SupportTaskKeyResults`. | Medium | Some tasks support "All KRs" (5 tasks) or "Parent company" (4 Talenta tasks). For "All KRs", link to all 6. For "Parent company", link to none (these are overhead, not OKR-driven). |
| TS-17 | SupportTask priority field | Excel has High/Medium/Low priorities. | Low | Reuse existing `TaskPriority` enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH). |
| TS-18 | SupportTask owner (TeamMember) | Excel assigns Azlan (14 tasks) or Khairul (16 tasks). Izyani has none. | Low | Reuse existing `TeamMember` enum. |

### Seed Migration

| # | Feature | Why Required | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| TS-19 | Wipe and reseed from MotionVii_SAAP_2026_v2.xlsx | New Excel has completely different structure: separate sheets for OKR Summary, Key Results, Initiatives, Support Tasks. Old seed reads single sheet. Complete rewrite of seed.ts. | High | Critical path. Must parse 4 sheets. Must create in order: Objectives (implicit from enum) -> KeyResults (6) -> Initiatives (37) -> SupportTasks (30) -> SupportTask-KR links. |
| TS-20 | Seed parses Key Results sheet | 6 KRs with full metadata: description, metricType, target, actual, unit, deadline, status, owner, howWeMeasure, notes. | Medium | Row structure known from Excel parse. KR IDs: KR1.1, KR1.2, KR1.3, KR2.1, KR2.2, KR2.3. |
| TS-21 | Seed parses Initiatives sheet | 37 initiatives with new column mapping: ID, KR, Objective, Initiative, Department, Start Date, End Date, Budget, Resources, Person In Charge, Accountable, Status, Progress, Remarks. | Medium | Column order changed from v1. KR column now links to KeyResult model, not stored as string. Department mapping includes "Marketing" (new for v2). |
| TS-22 | Seed parses Support Tasks sheet | 30 support tasks: ID, Category, Task, Supports, Owner, Frequency, Priority, Notes. | Medium | "Supports" column has comma-separated KR IDs or "All KRs" or "Parent company". Parse and link. |
| TS-23 | Seed wipes Initiative, KeyResult, SupportTask tables | Clean slate. Old data from v1 Excel is replaced. Must delete in correct FK order. | Low | Delete order: SupportTask-KR join -> SupportTask -> Initiative (including comments) -> KeyResult. Preserve unrelated tables (Company, Deal, Project, etc.). |

### UI Changes

| # | Feature | Why Required | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| TS-24 | OKR hierarchy UI shows KR metrics | Current KeyResultGroup component shows KR label and aggregated initiative KPIs. After v2.0, KR row must show: description, target/actual, progress bar, status badge, owner. | Medium | Repurpose existing KpiProgressBar component. Data source changes from initiative-level KPI aggregation to KR-level fields. Simpler and cleaner. |
| TS-25 | KR row shows progress bar with percentage | Visual indicator of KR progress. Standard in every OKR tool. Color-coded: green (>=80%), yellow (>=50%), red (<50%). | Low | Already have KpiProgressBar component with this exact color logic. Reuse. |
| TS-26 | KR row shows status badge | NOT_STARTED, ON_TRACK, BEHIND, AT_RISK, ACHIEVED displayed as colored badge. | Low | Reuse existing getStatusColor pattern. Add new status values to color map. |
| TS-27 | KR row shows owner | Display who owns the KR (Khairul/Azlan). Small avatar or name badge. | Low | Reuse formatTeamMember utility. |
| TS-28 | Objective row shows rollup progress | Objective progress = weighted average of child KR progress. Display as percentage and progress bar in objective header. | Medium | New calculation. Current ObjectiveGroup shows counts (total, completed, in-progress, at-risk). Add progress percentage from KR rollup. |
| TS-29 | Support Tasks page | New route `/support-tasks` with table/list of 30 support tasks. Must support category filtering (4 categories). | Medium | New page. Pattern follows existing list views (e.g., /initiatives list view). |
| TS-30 | Support Tasks category filter | Filter by DESIGN_CREATIVE, BUSINESS_ADMIN, TALENTA_IDEAS, OPERATIONS. | Low | Standard filter pattern used throughout app. |
| TS-31 | Revenue target dashboard widget | New widget showing RM1M total target with breakdown: Events RM800K (80%), AI Training RM200K (20%). Shows actual vs target with progress bars. | Medium | New widget in widget registry. Category: "financials". Data from KR1.1 actual (events revenue) and KR2.2 actual (training revenue). |

### Navigation

| # | Feature | Why Required | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| TS-32 | Support Tasks nav item | Add to sidebar navigation. Support tasks are a first-class concept in the app. | Low | Pattern: add to sidebar links array. Consider grouping under OKR section with Objectives/Initiatives. |

---

## Differentiators

Features that improve the experience beyond minimum requirements. Build if time permits, defer otherwise.

### Smart Status & Progress

| # | Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| D-01 | Objective progress rollup with configurable weights | Instead of simple average, allow KR weights to influence objective progress. Formula: `Obj Progress = Sum(KR_progress_i * KR_weight_i)` where weights sum to 1.0. Standard in Profit.co, Viva Goals, Perdoo. | Low | Weight field is table-stakes (TS-07), but the rollup calculation using weights is a differentiator. Default: equal weights (1/N). |
| D-02 | Auto-derive KR status from progress + timeline | Industry pattern (Microsoft Viva Goals): compare actual progress against expected progress based on elapsed time. If gap > 25%: AT_RISK. If gap > 0%: BEHIND. If gap <= 0%: ON_TRACK. Removes need for manual status updates. | Medium | Requires parsing deadline ("Q3 2026" -> specific date) and computing expected progress. Could be optional toggle per KR. |
| D-03 | KR check-in history | Instead of just current actual value, track check-in history: date, value, notes. Shows progress over time. Standard in Viva Goals, Profit.co, Lattice. | Medium | New model: KeyResultCheckIn (keyResultId, date, value, notes). Replaces direct `actual` field edits with audit trail. Defer to v2.1 -- for MVP, direct `actual` update is sufficient. |
| D-04 | Revenue target widget with dual-stream breakdown | Beyond a simple progress bar, show Events vs AI Training as stacked or side-by-side bars with individual targets and actuals. Like a mini P&L for the two revenue streams. | Low | Uses Recharts (already installed). Two BarChart bars or two progress bars in a card. Data: KR1.1 actual + KR2.2 actual. |
| D-05 | Support Task completion tracking | Allow marking support tasks as done-per-instance (e.g., "Designed proposal deck for Client X"). Not a simple checkbox -- recurring tasks are done multiple times. | Medium | Could add SupportTaskCompletion join table (supportTaskId, completedAt, notes). But adds complexity. For v2.0 MVP, support tasks are a reference list, not a tracking tool. Defer. |
| D-06 | Support Task workload view by owner | Show Azlan has 14 tasks (mostly Design & Creative), Khairul has 16 tasks. Helps with capacity planning -- especially since Excel notes "Watch for bottlenecks on Azlan (design) and Khairul (business)." | Low | Group-by-owner view on Support Tasks page. Simple aggregation, no new data needed. |
| D-07 | KR-level initiative count badge | On the KR row in hierarchy view, show how many initiatives support it. Already exists implicitly (keyResult.totalInitiatives in current GroupedKeyResult), but making it more prominent alongside KR metrics. | Low | Already computed. Just adjust UI layout. |
| D-08 | Support Tasks linked-KR display | On each support task row, show which KR(s) it supports as badges. Helps team understand why the task matters. | Low | Render from many-to-many relation. Small KR badges (e.g., "KR1.1", "KR2.2"). |
| D-09 | Initiative progress field (manual %) | Excel has a "Progress" column on Initiatives that is currently empty. Could allow manual progress entry per initiative. | Low | `progress Int? @default(0)` on Initiative. 0-100 range. Not auto-calculated. |
| D-10 | Objective header shows revenue target alignment | For Obj 1 (Scale Events), show "RM800K target" inline. For Obj 2 (AI Training), show "RM200K target". Connects objectives to business numbers. | Low | Hardcode or derive from revenue-type KRs under each objective. |

### Data Integrity

| # | Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| D-11 | Seed validation and summary report | After seeding, print summary: 2 objectives, 6 KRs, 37 initiatives, 30 support tasks, N KR-task links. Validates completeness. | Low | Console output at end of seed script. Already partially done in v1 seed. |
| D-12 | Seed idempotency guard | Prevent accidental double-seed. Check if KeyResult records exist before running. Prompt for confirmation or require `--force` flag. | Low | Safety net. Current seed just deletes-and-recreates. Good enough for dev, but a guard prevents accidents. |

---

## Anti-Features

Features to deliberately NOT build in v2.0. Common mistakes in this domain.

| # | Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|---|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| AF-01 | Complex OKR scoring system (Google 0-1 scale, Say/Do ratio) | Overkill for 3-person team with 6 KRs. Google's scoring adds ceremony without value at this scale. Multiple scoring methods create confusion. | Simple percentage: `actual/target * 100`. One method, universally understood. |
| AF-02 | KR check-in workflows with approval | Enterprise OKR tools (Viva Goals, Lattice) have check-in cycles with manager approval. This is process overhead for a self-managing 3-person team. | Direct edit of KR actual value. No approval flow. Trust the team. |
| AF-03 | Cascading/aligned OKRs across teams | Multi-team alignment (company OKRs cascade to team OKRs cascade to individual OKRs) is irrelevant. There is one team with one set of objectives. | Flat structure: 2 Objectives -> 6 KRs -> 37 Initiatives. No cascading. |
| AF-04 | OKR time period/cycle management | Enterprise tools manage Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 cycles, annual vs quarterly OKRs, cycle transitions. Motionvii has one annual cycle (2026). | Hardcode 2026 timeframe. No cycle management UI. KR deadlines are strings ("Q3 2026", "Q4 2026"). |
| AF-05 | AI-generated OKR suggestions | Some OKR tools use AI to suggest KRs or refine wording. Unnecessary -- the team has already defined their OKRs in Excel with careful thought. | Import from Excel as-is. KR descriptions and measurements come from human strategic thinking. |
| AF-06 | Recurring task auto-generation | Tools like ClickUp and Planner auto-create task instances based on frequency. Support tasks in SAAP are a reference list of what needs to happen, not a task queue that generates work items. | Display support tasks with frequency label. Do NOT auto-create "instances" on a schedule. |
| AF-07 | Support task time tracking | Tracking hours spent on support tasks is a time-tracking feature, not an OKR feature. Excel notes "Track hours to manage capacity" for Talenta tasks, but this is aspirational, not v2.0 scope. | Show task count by owner for rough capacity awareness (D-06). No hour tracking. |
| AF-08 | Real-time KR progress from CRM data | Auto-calculate KR1.1 actual from won deals, KR1.2 from partnerships, etc. Tempting but fragile -- requires mapping CRM concepts to OKR concepts, and the mappings are not 1:1 (e.g., "active partnership" is not a CRM entity). | Manual KR actual updates. The team reviews monthly and updates. Keep it human-driven. |
| AF-09 | Support task CRUD (create/edit/delete) | Support tasks are seeded from Excel. The team does not need to manage them through the UI -- they are reference material. Adding CRUD adds complexity without value for 30 static tasks. | Read-only display. If tasks change, update Excel and reseed. |
| AF-10 | Drag-and-drop KR reordering | KRs have a natural order (KR1.1, KR1.2, KR1.3, KR2.1, KR2.2, KR2.3). Reordering is meaningless. | Sort by KR ID (string sort works: "KR1.1" < "KR1.2" < "KR2.1"). |
| AF-11 | OKR export to Excel | v1.5 already exports initiatives to Excel. Exporting the full OKR tree to Excel would duplicate the source Excel that the data came from. | If needed later, extend v1.5 export. Not v2.0 scope. |
| AF-12 | Multiple Objective enums | Current schema has 2-value enum (OBJ1_SCALE_EVENTS, OBJ2_BUILD_AI_TRAINING). Do NOT make Objective a full model with CRUD -- there are only 2 objectives and they do not change. | Keep Objective as Prisma enum. Add display labels in utils.ts (already done). KeyResult has objective field referencing enum. |

## Feature Dependencies

```
Objective (enum, already exists)
  |
  +-- KeyResult (NEW model) [TS-01 through TS-08]
       |
       +-- Initiative (MODIFIED: FK to KeyResult) [TS-09, TS-10, TS-11]
       |    |
       |    +-- [existing relations: Comments, Projects]
       |
       +-- SupportTask (NEW model, many-to-many) [TS-13 through TS-18]

Seed Migration [TS-19 through TS-23]
  -- Depends on: All schema changes (TS-01 through TS-18)
  -- Must run AFTER: Prisma migration applied
  -- Must run BEFORE: Any UI work can be tested

UI: OKR Hierarchy [TS-24 through TS-28]
  -- Depends on: KeyResult model + seed data
  -- Modifies: objective-hierarchy.tsx, key-result-group.tsx, objective-group.tsx

UI: Support Tasks Page [TS-29 through TS-32]
  -- Depends on: SupportTask model + seed data
  -- New route: /support-tasks

UI: Revenue Target Widget [TS-31]
  -- Depends on: KeyResult model with actual values
  -- Reads: KR1.1 actual (events revenue) + KR2.2 actual (training revenue)
  -- Adds to: Widget registry, widget-bank categories
```

Critical path: **Schema -> Migration -> Seed -> UI**. All UI work is blocked on having data to display.

---

## MVP Recommendation

For v2.0 MVP, prioritize in this order:

### Must Ship (Table Stakes)

1. **KeyResult model + Initiative FK migration** (TS-01 through TS-12) -- The structural change that defines v2.0
2. **SupportTask model** (TS-13 through TS-18) -- Second major data model addition
3. **Wipe and reseed** (TS-19 through TS-23) -- Cannot test anything without data
4. **OKR hierarchy UI update** (TS-24 through TS-28) -- Primary display of new KR data
5. **Support Tasks page** (TS-29 through TS-32) -- Display new support task data
6. **Revenue target widget** (TS-31) -- Dashboard visibility into the RM1M goal

### Include If Time Permits

7. **Weighted objective rollup** (D-01) -- Low effort, meaningful improvement
8. **Revenue widget dual-stream breakdown** (D-04) -- Low effort, better visualization
9. **Support task workload by owner** (D-06) -- Low effort, capacity awareness
10. **Support task KR badges** (D-08) -- Low effort, context for tasks
11. **Initiative progress field** (D-09) -- Low effort, fills Excel "Progress" column gap

### Defer to v2.1+

- **Auto-derive KR status** (D-02) -- Needs deadline parsing, medium effort
- **KR check-in history** (D-03) -- Adds model complexity, manual updates sufficient for now
- **Support task completion tracking** (D-05) -- Adds model complexity, reference list sufficient
- **Seed idempotency guard** (D-12) -- Nice safety but not blocking
