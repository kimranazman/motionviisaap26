# Feature Research: Initiative Intelligence & Export

**Domain:** OKR/Initiative Management with KPI Tracking, Date Intelligence & Export
**Context:** 3-person team (Khairul, Azlan, Izyani), 2 Objectives, ~28 initiatives, linked projects
**Researched:** 2026-01-26
**Confidence:** HIGH (well-established domain patterns, existing codebase thoroughly understood)

## Context

This research addresses v1.5 features for SAAP2026v2:

- **By Objective view:** Three-level hierarchy (Objective > Key Result > Initiatives) as a new default view
- **KPI tracking:** Target/actual metrics per initiative, auto-calculated from linked projects, manually overridable
- **Linked project visibility:** Inline display of connected projects with status, revenue, costs
- **Date intelligence:** Duration flags, date validation, timeline overlap detection
- **Excel export:** Export initiatives data with objectives, KRs, status, metrics, dates
- **Text wrapping:** Initiative titles display in full (no truncation)

The existing system has:
- 2 Objectives enum: `OBJ1_SCALE_EVENTS`, `OBJ2_BUILD_AI_TRAINING`
- Key Results stored as free-text `keyResult` field (e.g., "KR1.1", "KR2.3")
- Initiatives with: title, objective, keyResult, department, status, owner, dates, monthly objectives, weekly tasks, resources, remarks, comments
- Projects can be linked to initiatives via `initiativeId` foreign key
- Projects have: revenue, potentialRevenue, costs, status, deliverables, tasks
- `xlsx` library v0.18.5 already installed in the project

## Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features that are fundamental to the v1.5 scope. Without these, the milestone feels incomplete.

### 1. By Objective Hierarchy View

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Implementation Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Objective grouping** | OKR tools universally group by objective; this is the primary strategic lens | Low | Group initiatives by `objective` enum (2 groups) |
| **Key Result sub-grouping** | KRs are the measurement layer between objectives and initiatives; grouping by KR shows strategic alignment | Medium | Parse `keyResult` field to group (e.g., "KR1.1", "KR1.2" under Obj 1) |
| **Expandable/collapsible sections** | Standard UX pattern in hierarchy views; lets users focus on one objective at a time | Low | Simple state toggle per section, default expanded |
| **Initiative count per group** | Users need to see distribution at a glance ("Obj 1 has 15, Obj 2 has 13") | Low | Count display in section header |
| **Status summary per group** | Quick health check per objective/KR without scanning every row | Medium | Aggregate status counts shown as mini-badges or progress indicator in header |
| **Default view** | This should be the landing view for /initiatives; existing views become tabs/toggles | Low | Add view toggle: "By Objective" (default), "List", and existing Kanban/Timeline/Calendar views |
| **Full text display** | Initiative titles are long strategic descriptions; truncation loses context | Low | Remove `truncate` CSS class, allow wrapping |

**Research basis:** All major OKR tools (Viva Goals, Jira Align, Synergita, Weekdone, Mooncamp) provide hierarchy views as a primary navigation pattern. The expandable tree list is the most common pattern for small-to-medium datasets. Card-based chart views and visual family trees are used for larger organizations but are overkill for 28 initiatives across 2 objectives. [HIGH confidence - consistent pattern across all OKR tools surveyed]

**Recommendation:** Use the **expandable list pattern** (not a visual tree diagram). With only 2 objectives and ~6-8 key results, the hierarchy is shallow enough that a grouped list with collapsible sections is cleaner and more data-dense than a tree visualization. Each section shows: Objective header > KR sub-header > Initiative rows.

### 2. KPI Tracking (Target/Actual)

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Implementation Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Target metric per initiative** | Every KPI needs a target to measure against; without targets, tracking is meaningless | Low | New field: `kpiTarget` (Decimal) on Initiative model |
| **Actual metric per initiative** | The measured outcome; core of any KPI system | Low | New field: `kpiActual` (Decimal) on Initiative model |
| **KPI label/description** | Users need to know what the number represents (e.g., "Revenue RM", "Events Held", "Clients Signed") | Low | New field: `kpiLabel` (String) on Initiative model |
| **Auto-calculation from linked projects** | Revenue/cost data already exists in projects; manual re-entry is wasteful and error-prone | Medium | Sum `revenue` or `potentialRevenue` from projects where `initiativeId = this.id` |
| **Manual override** | Auto-calc is a starting point; some KPIs are not project-derived (e.g., "brand awareness") | Low | Allow manual entry that overrides calculated value; boolean `kpiManualOverride` flag |
| **Visual target vs actual display** | Progress bars or gauge showing how close actual is to target | Low | Simple progress bar: `(actual / target) * 100%` with color coding |
| **Rollup to KR/Objective level** | Strategic view needs aggregate metrics, not just per-initiative | Medium | Sum actuals and targets per KR group and per Objective group |

**Research basis:** Strategic planning tools (Cascade, BSC Designer, Spider Impact, PPM Express) all implement target/actual comparison as the fundamental KPI pattern. PPM Express specifically auto-calculates Key Result rollup as arithmetic mean of child items. The pattern of "auto-calculate with manual override" is standard in tools like monday.com and Cascade. [HIGH confidence - universal KPI pattern]

**Recommendation for auto-calculation logic:**
- **Default auto-calc:** Sum of `revenue` from all linked projects (where `initiative.projects[].revenue`)
- **KPI label determines what to sum:** If label contains "revenue" -> sum project revenue. If label contains "cost" -> sum project costs. If label contains "profit" -> sum (revenue - costs). Default -> sum revenue.
- **Manual override:** When user explicitly sets `kpiActual`, set `kpiManualOverride = true`. Display "(auto)" or "(manual)" indicator.
- **Recalculation trigger:** Recalculate on page load (not real-time); auto-calc runs when `kpiManualOverride = false`.

**Keep it simple for 3-person team:** Do NOT build formula engines, custom metric definitions, or weighted scoring. A single target/actual pair with a label per initiative is sufficient.

### 3. Linked Project Visibility

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Implementation Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Inline project list per initiative** | Users want to see which projects contribute to an initiative without navigating away | Low | Query `projects` relation, display in initiative row or expandable section |
| **Project status badge** | Quick health check: is the linked project active, completed, or stalled? | Low | Show `ProjectStatus` badge (Draft/Active/Completed/Cancelled) |
| **Project revenue display** | Core financial data; connects strategic initiatives to actual money | Low | Show `revenue` and/or `potentialRevenue` from project |
| **Project cost display** | Cost visibility helps assess initiative efficiency | Low | Sum of `costs` from project |
| **Link to project detail** | One-click navigation from initiative to project | Low | Link/button to `/projects` or open project detail modal |

**Research basis:** Tools like Leapsome, OpenProject, and Mooncamp all emphasize linking projects/tasks to OKRs for execution visibility. PPM Express has a dedicated "Contributing Projects" section on each Key Result. This is the bridge between strategy (OKRs) and execution (projects). [HIGH confidence]

**Recommendation:** Show linked projects as a compact inline list within the initiative row in the By Objective view. Each project shows: title (truncated), status badge, revenue, cost. Clicking opens the project detail modal. For the By Objective view, this goes under each initiative row as an expandable sub-section.

### 4. Date Intelligence

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Implementation Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Duration calculation** | Knowing how long an initiative spans is basic planning intel | Low | Calculate `endDate - startDate` in days/weeks/months |
| **Overdue flag** | Initiatives past end date but not completed need visual alerts | Low | If `endDate < today && status !== COMPLETED && status !== CANCELLED` -> flag |
| **Long duration warning** | Initiatives spanning too long may lack focus (e.g., >6 months) | Low | Configurable threshold; flag initiatives exceeding it |
| **Date validation** | End date before start date is a data integrity issue | Low | Validate `endDate >= startDate`; show warning badge |
| **Starting soon indicator** | Initiatives starting within 2 weeks need preparation attention | Low | If `startDate` is within 14 days and status is `NOT_STARTED` |
| **Timeline overlap detection** | Multiple initiatives by same owner overlapping may indicate overload | Medium | For each `personInCharge`, check date range intersections across their initiatives |

**Research basis:** Asana provides "Due date is approaching" and "Task is overdue" automated triggers. Salesforce uses formula-based validation with colored flag indicators for overdue status. ClickUp Brain detects schedule conflicts and resource overloads. All project management tools flag overdue items. [HIGH confidence for basic flags; MEDIUM confidence for overlap detection patterns]

**Recommended date intelligence rules:**

| Rule | Condition | Visual | Severity |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Overdue** | `endDate < today && status not in [COMPLETED, CANCELLED]` | Red badge "X days overdue" | Critical |
| **At Risk (ending soon)** | `endDate within 14 days && status not in [COMPLETED, CANCELLED]` | Orange badge "Ends in X days" | Warning |
| **Not Started (late start)** | `startDate < today && status === NOT_STARTED` | Yellow badge "Should have started" | Warning |
| **Long Duration** | `endDate - startDate > 180 days` | Gray badge "6+ months" | Info |
| **Invalid Dates** | `endDate < startDate` | Red badge "Invalid dates" | Error |
| **Owner Overlap** | Same `personInCharge` has >3 concurrent active initiatives | Orange badge "Workload: X concurrent" | Warning |

### 5. Excel Export

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Implementation Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Export all initiatives** | Getting data out for reporting/sharing is table stakes for planning tools | Low | Use existing `xlsx` library (v0.18.5 already installed) |
| **Include hierarchy context** | Export should show Objective and KR columns so data makes sense outside the app | Low | Add `Objective` and `Key Result` columns |
| **Include KPI data** | Target/actual metrics are the point of v1.5; must be exportable | Low | Add `KPI Label`, `Target`, `Actual`, `% Achievement` columns |
| **Include dates and duration** | Planning context requires date data | Low | Add `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Duration (days)` columns |
| **Include status and owner** | Core initiative metadata | Low | Add `Status`, `Owner`, `Department` columns |
| **Include linked project summary** | Show project count and total revenue per initiative | Low | Add `Linked Projects`, `Total Revenue`, `Total Costs` columns |
| **Filename with date** | Users download multiple exports over time; date in filename helps | Low | `SAAP_Initiatives_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` |

**Research basis:** SheetJS (`xlsx` v0.18.5) is already installed in the project. It supports `XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet()` for simple data export and `XLSX.writeFile()` for download. Client-side generation is sufficient for 28 rows of data. No need for server-side generation or streaming. [HIGH confidence - library already in project, well-documented pattern]

**Recommended export columns (in order):**

| Column | Source |
|--------|--------|
| # | `sequenceNumber` |
| Objective | `objective` (formatted) |
| Key Result | `keyResult` |
| Initiative | `title` |
| Department | `department` (formatted) |
| Status | `status` (formatted) |
| Owner | `personInCharge` (formatted) |
| Start Date | `startDate` (formatted) |
| End Date | `endDate` (formatted) |
| Duration (Days) | Calculated |
| KPI Label | `kpiLabel` |
| KPI Target | `kpiTarget` |
| KPI Actual | `kpiActual` |
| % Achievement | Calculated: `(actual/target)*100` |
| Linked Projects | Count of linked projects |
| Total Project Revenue | Sum of linked project revenues |
| Total Project Costs | Sum of linked project costs |
| Monthly Objective | `monthlyObjective` |
| Weekly Tasks | `weeklyTasks` |
| Remarks | `remarks` |

## Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that go beyond basic expectations and add unique value for this specific use case.

### 1. Smart Auto-Calculation with Context

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **KPI auto-calc from project financials** | No other small-team tool auto-derives KPIs from linked project data; this closes the strategy-execution gap | Medium | Unique because SAAP already has project revenue/cost data |
| **Objective-level rollup** | See total target vs actual per objective, not just per initiative | Low | Sum of initiative KPIs grouped by objective |
| **Achievement percentage with color coding** | Instant visual feedback on strategic progress | Low | Green >80%, yellow 50-80%, red <50% |

### 2. Owner Workload Intelligence

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Concurrent initiative count per person** | For 3-person team, knowing who is overloaded is critical | Low | Count active initiatives per `personInCharge` |
| **Timeline overlap visualization** | See which initiatives overlap for same person | Medium | Highlight overlapping date ranges in the By Objective view |
| **Owner filter in hierarchy view** | "Show me just Khairul's initiatives across all objectives" | Low | Filter overlay on By Objective view |

### 3. Integrated Date + Status Intelligence

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Composite health score** | Combine status + date + KPI into a single "health" indicator per initiative | Medium | Overdue + AT_RISK + below target = "Critical"; all green = "Healthy" |
| **Date intelligence summary in header** | "3 overdue, 2 ending soon, 1 not started" as a banner | Low | Aggregate date flags across all initiatives |

---

## Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features to deliberately NOT build. These are common in enterprise OKR tools but wrong for a 3-person internal team.

| Anti-Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Visual tree diagram** | Looks impressive in OKR tools like Synergita/Viva Goals | Overkill for 2 objectives; SVG/canvas complexity for no gain; hard to make responsive | Expandable grouped list achieves same hierarchy visibility |
| **Weighted KPI scoring** | Enterprise tools weight KRs differently (e.g., 40/30/30) | 3-person team does not need formula-based weighting; adds complexity without value | Simple sum/average is sufficient |
| **OKR confidence voting** | Tools like Weekdone let teams vote on OKR confidence weekly | Meaningful for 50+ people; absurd for 3 people who talk daily | Status field (NOT_STARTED through COMPLETED) is sufficient |
| **Automated OKR suggestions (AI)** | AI-powered OKR writing is trending (Quantive, Mooncamp) | Generating OKRs is not the bottleneck for a team that already defined 28 initiatives | Keep AI for document analysis where it adds real value |
| **Multi-period OKR tracking** | Enterprise tools track Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 separately | SAAP is an annual plan for 2026; no quarterly cycling needed | Single annual view is correct |
| **Cascading OKRs (top-down)** | Large orgs cascade from company > department > team > individual | Only 2 objectives, 1 team, 3 people; cascading adds zero value | Flat Objective > KR > Initiative hierarchy is sufficient |
| **Custom metric formulas** | Tools like BSC Designer allow arbitrary formulas per KPI | Massive complexity; 28 initiatives do not need a formula engine | Single target/actual pair per initiative |
| **PDF export with charts** | Some tools export formatted PDF reports with embedded charts | Complex rendering; Excel is more useful for data manipulation | Excel export only; users can chart in Excel if needed |
| **CSV export (separate from Excel)** | Some tools offer CSV alongside Excel | CSV loses formatting, multi-sheet capability; Excel is strictly superior | Excel-only export |
| **Real-time KPI updates** | Enterprise dashboards update KPIs in real-time via websockets | 3 users, 28 initiatives; page refresh is fine | Recalculate on page load |
| **KPI history/trending** | Track KPI values over time to show progress curves | Requires temporal data storage, charting; overkill for annual plan | Current snapshot is sufficient for v1.5 |
| **Drag-and-drop reordering in hierarchy view** | Some OKR tools allow reordering objectives/KRs | Objectives and KRs are fixed strategic structure; reordering implies they change frequently | Static ordering by objective enum and KR string sort |

## Feature Dependencies

```
                    By Objective View
                    (Foundation - build first)
                          |
              +-----------+-----------+
              |                       |
        KPI Tracking            Date Intelligence
        (Needs initiative       (Needs initiative
         rows to display)        rows to display)
              |                       |
              +-----+-----------------+
                    |
             Linked Project Visibility
             (Enriches KPI auto-calc
              and initiative rows)
                    |
              Excel Export
              (Needs all data assembled
               to export complete dataset)
```

**Dependency reasoning:**
1. **By Objective View** must come first because it establishes the new page layout and data fetching pattern that all other features attach to.
2. **KPI Tracking** and **Date Intelligence** are independent of each other but both depend on the initiative rows being rendered in the hierarchy view.
3. **Linked Project Visibility** depends on KPI tracking (auto-calc needs project data) and enriches the initiative display.
4. **Excel Export** comes last because it exports ALL the data from the other features; building it first would mean reworking it as each feature adds columns.

---

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v1.5 - This Milestone)

**All of these are in scope and expected:**

1. **By Objective hierarchy view** as the default /initiatives page
   - Objective > KR > Initiative expandable grouping
   - Initiative count and status summary per group
   - Full text display (no truncation) for initiative titles
   - View toggle to switch between By Objective, List, Kanban, Timeline, Calendar

2. **KPI tracking per initiative**
   - `kpiLabel`, `kpiTarget`, `kpiActual` fields on Initiative model
   - Auto-calculation from linked project revenue (when no manual override)
   - Manual override capability with indicator
   - Target vs actual visual (progress bar with color coding)
   - Rollup display at KR and Objective level

3. **Linked project inline visibility**
   - Project title, status badge, revenue, costs shown per initiative
   - Click-through to project detail
   - Project count badge on initiative row

4. **Date intelligence flags**
   - Overdue detection (red)
   - Ending soon warning (orange)
   - Late start detection (yellow)
   - Long duration info flag (gray)
   - Invalid date error (red)
   - Owner overlap/workload warning (orange)

5. **Excel export**
   - Single-click "Export to Excel" button
   - All columns from recommended export schema
   - Client-side generation using existing `xlsx` library
   - Date-stamped filename

### Add After Validation (v1.5.x - If Needed)

Features that might surface as needed after v1.5 ships:

| Feature | When to Add | Why Defer |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **KR-level KPI targets** | If team wants to track KR outcomes separately from initiative KPIs | KR is a free-text field; adding targets requires KR to become an entity |
| **Multi-sheet Excel export** | If team wants separate sheets per objective | Single sheet is sufficient for 28 rows |
| **Export with conditional formatting** | If team wants colored cells in Excel matching app status colors | `xlsx` community edition has limited styling; ExcelJS would be needed |
| **Date intelligence settings** | If team wants to customize thresholds (e.g., "overdue after 7 days" vs "immediately") | Hardcoded thresholds are fine initially |
| **Saved filters in hierarchy view** | If team frequently uses specific filter combinations | Three people, unlikely to need saved views |

### Future Consideration (v2+)

| Feature | Why v2+ | Prerequisite |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **KR as first-class entity** | Currently `keyResult` is a free-text string; making it a model enables KR-level tracking, targets, owners | Schema migration, data migration from string to relation |
| **Objective progress dashboard widget** | Visual widget for the customizable dashboard showing objective health | v1.5 KPI data must exist first |
| **Initiative health timeline** | Historical tracking of status changes over time | ActivityLog extension to initiatives |
| **Cross-initiative dependency mapping** | "Initiative A blocks Initiative B" | New relation model, dependency visualization |
| **Quarter-over-quarter comparison** | Compare Q1 vs Q2 progress | Temporal KPI snapshots, period model |

## Feature Prioritization Matrix

Priority based on: user value (how much the 3-person team needs it), complexity (effort to build), and risk (likelihood of complications).

| Feature | User Value | Complexity | Risk | Priority |
|---------|------------|------------|------|----------|
| By Objective view | **Critical** | Low | Low | **P0** |
| Full text wrapping | **High** | Trivial | None | **P0** |
| KPI target/actual fields | **Critical** | Low | Low | **P0** |
| KPI auto-calc from projects | **High** | Medium | Low | **P1** |
| KPI manual override | **High** | Low | Low | **P1** |
| KPI visual (progress bar) | **High** | Low | Low | **P1** |
| Linked project inline display | **High** | Low | Low | **P1** |
| Overdue flag | **Critical** | Low | None | **P0** |
| Ending soon warning | **High** | Low | None | **P1** |
| Late start detection | **Medium** | Low | None | **P1** |
| Long duration flag | **Medium** | Low | None | **P2** |
| Invalid date validation | **Medium** | Low | None | **P2** |
| Owner overlap detection | **Medium** | Medium | Low | **P2** |
| Excel export | **High** | Low | Low | **P1** |
| KR/Objective rollup | **Medium** | Medium | Low | **P2** |
| Date intelligence summary banner | **Medium** | Low | None | **P2** |

**P0 = Must ship. P1 = Should ship. P2 = Nice to have in milestone.**

## Technical Considerations

### Schema Changes Required

```prisma
model Initiative {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // New KPI fields (v1.5)
  kpiLabel          String?  @map("kpi_label") @db.VarChar(100)
  kpiTarget         Decimal? @map("kpi_target") @db.Decimal(12, 2)
  kpiActual         Decimal? @map("kpi_actual") @db.Decimal(12, 2)
  kpiManualOverride Boolean  @default(false) @map("kpi_manual_override")
}
```

### Key Result Grouping Strategy

The `keyResult` field is a free-text VarChar(20) storing values like "KR1.1", "KR1.2", "KR2.1". To group by KR:

1. **Parse the prefix:** Extract the numeric part before the dot (e.g., "KR1" from "KR1.1") to group under the objective
2. **Sort within group:** Sort by the full KR string (natural sort: KR1.1, KR1.2, KR1.3, KR2.1, etc.)
3. **Display:** Show the raw KR string as the sub-group header

This works because the data is already structured with a convention (KR[objective_num].[kr_num]).

### Auto-Calculation Logic

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for KPI auto-calculation
async function calculateInitiativeKPI(initiative: Initiative): Promise<number | null> {
  if (initiative.kpiManualOverride) {
    return initiative.kpiActual; // User set this manually
  }

  const projects = await prisma.project.findMany({
    where: { initiativeId: initiative.id },
    include: { costs: true },
  });

  if (projects.length === 0) return null;

  // Default: sum revenue from linked projects
  return projects.reduce((sum, p) => sum + (Number(p.revenue) || 0), 0);
}
```

### Excel Export Architecture

Client-side export using existing `xlsx` v0.18.5:

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for Excel export
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';

function exportInitiatives(initiatives: InitiativeWithKPI[]) {
  const data = initiatives.map(i => ({
    '#': i.sequenceNumber,
    'Objective': formatObjective(i.objective),
    'Key Result': i.keyResult,
    'Initiative': i.title,
    // ... all columns
  }));

  const ws = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(data);
  const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new();
  XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, 'Initiatives');
  XLSX.writeFile(wb, `SAAP_Initiatives_${formatDate(new Date())}.xlsx`);
}
```
