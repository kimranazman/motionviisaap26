## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Zero new npm dependencies for v1.5 -- existing shadcn/ui, date-fns, xlsx cover all needs
- Separate /objectives route (not tabs on existing page) -- distinct data requirements
- xlsx export-only use is safe per SheetJS CVE advisory

### Pending Todos

None.
