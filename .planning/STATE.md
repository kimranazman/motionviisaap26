## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Remove sidebar footer entirely | Settings + revenue display both removed, cleaner UI |
| 01-01 | User dropdown shows info only | No Profile/Settings/Logout until auth implemented |
| 01-01 | Edit on detail page, not separate route | Plan 02 implements inline editing |
| 01-02 | Inline editing on detail page | Simpler UX, fewer routes to maintain |
| 02-02 | Notifications show all initiatives | No user filtering until auth implemented |
| 02-02 | Badge hidden during loading | Prevents flicker (Pitfall 3 from research) |

### Pending Todos

None.
