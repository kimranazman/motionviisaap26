## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v2.5 Decisions:**
- Create "Work" nav group between SAAP and CRM (not at end) for logical flow
- Keep URL `/potential-projects` unchanged when renaming to "Repeat Clients" (minimize migration risk)
- Keep database model name `PotentialProject` unchanged (internal implementation detail)
- Add children to Members in topLevelItems using same pattern as Companies nested nav

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
