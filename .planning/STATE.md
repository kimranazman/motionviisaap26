### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| v1.1 roadmap | 5 phases for auth | Natural grouping: foundation, roles, protection, admin, UI |

| 04-02 | JWT session strategy | Edge middleware compatible |
| 04-02 | Server-side domain validation | hd parameter alone insufficient for security |
| 04-03 | Server action for signIn | Avoids client component for login page |
| 04-03 | SignOutButton as client component | Required for onClick handler |
