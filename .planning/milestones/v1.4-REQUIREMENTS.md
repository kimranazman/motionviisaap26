## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Supplier portal/login | Massive complexity for 3-person team |
| RFQ workflow | Overkill; manual quotes via email sufficient |
| Task dependencies/Gantt | Initiatives have Gantt; tasks are simpler |
| Time tracking on tasks | Separate domain; use external tools |
| Real-time price API | No API integration; manual entry only |
| ML price forecasting | Low volume; insufficient data |
| Invoice generation | SAAP tracks invoices, doesn't generate them |
| Full audit trail | Activity history for sync events only, not all fields |
