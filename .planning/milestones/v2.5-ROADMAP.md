# Milestone v2.5: Navigation Reorganization

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 72-74
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Reorganize sidebar navigation to group related items logically, rename "Potential Projects" to "Repeat Clients", and add quick navigation links to individual team member pages.

## Phases

### Phase 72: Create Work Group & Move Items

**Goal:** Create a new "Work" navigation group containing Projects and Tasks together
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 72-01: Create Work nav group, move Projects from CRM, move Tasks from topLevelItems

**Details:**
Created a new "Work" navigation group at index 1 (between SAAP and CRM groups) containing Projects and Tasks together for a more logical navigation structure. The sidebar and mobile-sidebar components dynamically iterate over navGroups array, so no functional code changes were needed.

**Commits:**
- b19b5d1: feat(72): create Work navigation group and move Projects/Tasks
- 5de5a5e: docs(72): complete Create Work Group & Move Items phase
- cf27fd9: docs(72-01): add plan artifact

### Phase 73: Rename Potential Projects to Repeat Clients

**Goal:** Rename "Potential Projects" to "Repeat Clients" throughout the application UI
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 73-01: Update nav label, page header, dialog title, toast messages, and modal section headers

**Details:**
Successfully renamed all user-facing "Potential Projects" UI text to "Repeat Clients" across the application. URLs (/potential-projects) and database models (PotentialProject) remain unchanged as they are implementation details.

**Files Modified:**
- src/lib/nav-config.ts
- src/app/(dashboard)/potential-projects/page.tsx
- src/components/potential-projects/potential-form-modal.tsx
- src/components/potential-projects/potential-detail-sheet.tsx
- src/components/departments/department-detail-modal.tsx
- src/components/contacts/contact-detail-modal.tsx
- src/components/companies/company-detail-modal.tsx

### Phase 74: Members Quick Navigation Links

**Goal:** Add clickable children to Members nav item for quick access to individual team member pages
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 74-01: Add children array to Members nav item, update desktop and mobile sidebar rendering

**Details:**
Members nav item now has children array with 3 team members (Khairul, Azlan, Izyani). Desktop and mobile sidebars render Members with expandable chevron. Clicking Members text navigates to /members overview. Clicking chevron expands/collapses children. Each child link navigates to /members/[name]. Active child route auto-expands parent.

**Commits:**
- 48b177c: feat(74-01): add children to Members in nav-config
- dc74c2e: feat(74-01): add nested rendering to desktop sidebar
- 9f5b28d: feat(74-01): add nested rendering to mobile sidebar
- c9f4bba: docs(74-01): complete members quick navigation links plan
- 755d64c: docs(74): complete members quick navigation links phase

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Create "Work" nav group between SAAP and CRM (not at end) for logical flow
- Keep URL `/potential-projects` unchanged when renaming to "Repeat Clients" (minimize migration risk)
- Keep database model name `PotentialProject` unchanged (internal implementation detail)
- Add children to Members in topLevelItems using same pattern as Companies nested nav

**Issues Resolved:**
- Navigation structure now groups work items (Projects, Tasks) together
- "Potential Projects" terminology updated to more business-friendly "Repeat Clients"
- Quick access to individual team member pages from sidebar

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
