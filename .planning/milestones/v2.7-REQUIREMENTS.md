## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Not in current roadmap.

(None identified — v2.7 is a complete feature)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Inline value editing | Full modal edit is sufficient per user spec |
| Price trend charts | Keep it simple; tabular data is enough |
| AI-powered service categorization | Not needed; service titles are user-entered |
| Comparison with competitor pricing | External data not available |
| Service templates/presets | Out of scope for pricing history view |
