# Requirements: SAAP2026v2

**Defined:** 2026-01-25
**Core Value:** Users can compare supplier prices for the same item by filtering a table - AI categorizes items, users do the comparison.

## v1.4.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.4.1 Line Item Categorization & Price Table.

**Context:** v1.4 built on-demand semantic search for price comparison. The actual need was simpler: AI categorizes line items into normalized product names, then users filter a table to compare prices manually. This patch corrects that.

### Line Item Categorization

- [x] **ITEM-01**: Cost entry has `normalizedItem` field (AI-assigned category)
- [x] **ITEM-02**: AI assigns normalizedItem when cost is created
- [x] **ITEM-03**: AI updates normalizedItem when cost description changes
- [x] **ITEM-04**: User can manually edit normalizedItem if AI got it wrong

### Supplier Items Table

- [x] **ITEM-05**: User can view table of all line items across all suppliers
- [x] **ITEM-06**: Table shows: item description, normalizedItem, supplier, unit price, project
- [x] **ITEM-07**: User can filter table by normalizedItem (category)
- [x] **ITEM-08**: User can filter table by supplier
- [x] **ITEM-09**: User can sort table by price to compare

## v1.4.2 Requirements

Requirements for v1.4.2 UI Polish & Bug Fixes (Phase 37).

### Bug Fix

- [x] Documents display correctly in project detail

### UX Improvement

- [x] Detail panels use centered Dialog/Modal instead of sliding Sheet
- [x] Modals are properly sized (600-700px default width)
- [x] Modals have scrollable content with max-height ~90vh
- [x] All existing CRUD operations work (costs, deliverables, tasks, documents)
- [x] Mobile responsive

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| AI semantic search | v1.4 built this; not needed - table filtering is sufficient |
| PriceComparisonSheet | Remove or deprecate - replaced by table filtering |
| Separate SupplierItem model | Reuse existing Cost model with supplier link |
| Price history tracking | Defer to v2 (SUPP-12) |
