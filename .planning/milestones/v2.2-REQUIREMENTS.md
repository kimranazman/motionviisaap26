- [x] **CAL-04**: Calendar displays full KR name (e.g., "KR1.1 - Achieve RM1M Revenue") not just identifier

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Event recurring schedule | Complexity not justified for one-time events |
| Calendar day view | Week view provides sufficient daily detail |
| Calendar drag-to-create events | Nice-to-have, not essential for 3-person team |
| Event notifications/reminders | Email notifications out of scope per project constraints |
| Event attendee tracking | Overkill for 3-person team |
