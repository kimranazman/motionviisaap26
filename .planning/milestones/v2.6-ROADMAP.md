## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Reuse @dnd-kit for projects kanban (already proven in 5+ kanban boards)
- Build simple custom calendar (no external library needed)
- Date markers only, no spanning (user explicitly requested to avoid clutter)
- Grey color for completed items (visual distinction without color distraction)
- View toggle pattern for projects (matches existing table/kanban toggle on /tasks)
- Empty topLevelItems after Members move (no top-level nav items remain)
- Tasks show "D" (due) marker only (Task model has no startDate field)
- Projects navigate to detail page on click (complex sheet interface avoided)

**Issues Resolved:**
- NavGroupComponent already supports nested items with children
- Calendar nav item already existed under SAAP group

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
