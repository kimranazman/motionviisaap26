## Objective

Rename all user-facing UI text from "Potential Projects" / "Potential" to "Repeat Clients" / "Repeat Client" throughout the application. URL paths and internal code names remain unchanged.

## Context

Phase 73 of v2.5 Navigation Reorganization. The term "Potential Projects" is being changed to "Repeat Clients" to better reflect business terminology. This is a UI label change only - no URL or database model changes.

## Requirements Covered

- RENAME-01: Change nav label to "Repeat Clients" in nav-config.ts
- RENAME-02: Update page title in /potential-projects/page.tsx to "Repeat Clients"
- RENAME-03: Update breadcrumbs/headers in potential-projects components to say "Repeat Clients"
- RENAME-04: Update any toast messages or UI text referencing "Potential Projects"

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Update navigation label in nav-config.ts

**File:** `src/lib/nav-config.ts`

**Change:** Line 73
- FROM: `{ name: 'Potential Projects', href: '/potential-projects', icon: FolderKanban }`
- TO: `{ name: 'Repeat Clients', href: '/potential-projects', icon: FolderKanban }`

**Note:** Keep href as `/potential-projects` (URL is implementation detail, not changed)
</task>

<task id="2">
Update page header title in page.tsx

**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/potential-projects/page.tsx`

**Change:** Line 61
- FROM: `title="Potential Projects"`
- TO: `title="Repeat Clients"`

**Note:** The description "Track repeat client opportunities" already aligns with the new naming
</task>

<task id="3">
Update dialog title in form modal

**File:** `src/components/potential-projects/potential-form-modal.tsx`

**Change:** Line 182
- FROM: `<DialogTitle>Add Potential Project</DialogTitle>`

**Changes:**

1. Line 241 - Toast messages:
   - FROM: `toast.success(updated.isArchived ? 'Potential archived' : 'Potential unarchived')`
   - TO: `toast.success(updated.isArchived ? 'Repeat client archived' : 'Repeat client unarchived')`

2. Line 325 - Read-only message:
   - FROM: `Converted potentials cannot be edited`
   - TO: `Converted repeat clients cannot be edited`
</task>

<task id="5">
Update section header in department detail modal

**File:** `src/components/departments/department-detail-modal.tsx`

**Change:** Line 350
- FROM: `Potential Projects ({department._count.potentials})`
- TO: `Repeat Clients ({department._count.potentials})`
</task>

<task id="6">
Update section header in contact detail modal

**File:** `src/components/contacts/contact-detail-modal.tsx`

- FROM: `Potential Projects ({contact.potentials.length})`
- TO: `Repeat Clients ({contact.potentials.length})`
</task>

<task id="7">
Update section header in company detail modal

</task>

## Verification

<verification>
1. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check sidebar navigation shows "Repeat Clients" under CRM group
3. Navigate to /potential-projects - page title should be "Repeat Clients"
4. Click "Add Project" button - dialog title should say "Add Repeat Client"
5. Open a repeat client detail sheet, archive it - toast should say "Repeat client archived"
6. For a converted repeat client, verify message shows "Converted repeat clients cannot be edited"
7. Open a Company detail modal with repeat clients - section header should say "Repeat Clients"
8. Open a Contact detail modal with repeat clients - section header should say "Repeat Clients"
9. Open a Department detail modal with repeat clients - section header should say "Repeat Clients"
10. Run TypeScript check: `npx tsc --noEmit` - should pass with no errors
