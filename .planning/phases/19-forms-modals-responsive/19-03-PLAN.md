<objective>
Update remaining form components (Projects, Potentials, Costs) to stack fields vertically on mobile screens.

Purpose: Complete the responsive form treatment for all remaining forms in the application.

Output: All project-related, potential-related, and cost forms use responsive grid layouts that stack on mobile.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Project Forms Mobile Stacking</name>
  <files>src/components/projects/project-form-modal.tsx, src/components/projects/project-detail-sheet.tsx, src/components/projects/cost-form.tsx</files>
  <action>
Read each file first to understand its current layout, then update:

**project-form-modal.tsx:**
1. Find any `grid-cols-2` and change to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
2. Update DialogFooter buttons with `w-full sm:w-auto`

**project-detail-sheet.tsx:**
1. Find any `grid-cols-2` and change to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
2. Update SheetFooter buttons with `w-full sm:w-auto`

**cost-form.tsx:**
1. Find any `grid-cols-2` and change to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
2. Update any submit/cancel buttons with `w-full sm:w-auto`

For each file, also ensure date picker buttons (if any) have adequate height: `h-11 md:h-10`
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors. Check project forms in mobile view - fields should stack vertically.
  </verify>
  <done>
Project form modal, project detail sheet, and cost form all show single-column layout on mobile, two columns on tablet+. Buttons are full-width on mobile.
  </done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Potential Project Forms Mobile Stacking</name>
  <files>src/components/potential-projects/potential-form-modal.tsx, src/components/potential-projects/potential-detail-sheet.tsx</files>
  <action>
Read each file first to understand its current layout, then update:

**potential-form-modal.tsx:**
1. Find any `grid-cols-2` and change to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
2. Update DialogFooter buttons with `w-full sm:w-auto`

**potential-detail-sheet.tsx:**
1. Find any `grid-cols-2` and change to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
2. Update SheetFooter buttons with `w-full sm:w-auto`

For each file, also ensure date picker buttons (if any) have adequate height: `h-11 md:h-10`
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors. Check potential project forms in mobile view - fields should stack vertically.
  </verify>
  <done>
Potential project form modal and detail sheet show single-column layout on mobile, two columns on tablet+. Buttons are full-width on mobile.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Initiative Detail Sheet Mobile Optimization</name>
  <files>src/components/kanban/initiative-detail-sheet.tsx</files>
  <action>
The initiative detail sheet already exists and uses SheetContent. Read the file to check:

1. Find any `grid-cols-2` and change to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
   - The Quick Info Grid around line 257 has `grid-cols-2 gap-4`
   - Change to `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`

2. Ensure the Save Changes button has `w-full sm:w-auto` (around line 349)

3. The SheetContent already has `w-full sm:max-w-lg` - verify this inherits the responsive width from Plan 01

4. Check if any other multi-column layouts need updating
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors. Check initiative detail sheet in mobile view - Quick Info Grid should stack.
  </verify>
  <done>
Initiative detail sheet shows stacked layout for Status/PIC/Department/Due Date on mobile, two columns on tablet+. Sheet is full-width on mobile.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:
1. `npm run build` passes without errors
2. Open app in Chrome DevTools mobile view (iPhone 12 Pro, 390px)
3. Open Project form - fields should stack vertically
4. Open Cost form - fields should stack vertically
5. Open Potential project form - fields should stack vertically
6. Open Initiative detail sheet (from Kanban) - Quick Info should stack
7. All form buttons should be full-width on mobile
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FRM-02 fully addressed: All form fields stack vertically on mobile
- All remaining forms (Project, Potential, Cost, Initiative detail) have responsive layouts
- Buttons are touch-friendly with full-width on mobile
- Forms are usable on phone screens without horizontal scrolling
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/19-forms-modals-responsive/19-03-SUMMARY.md`
