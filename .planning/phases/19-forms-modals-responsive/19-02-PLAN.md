<objective>
Update all form components to stack fields vertically on mobile screens.

Purpose: Forms with side-by-side fields are cramped and unusable on mobile. Converting to single-column on mobile ensures users can fill out forms without misclicks.

Output: All form components use responsive grid layouts that stack on mobile and show two columns on tablet+.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Initiative Form Mobile Stacking</name>
  <files>src/components/initiatives/initiative-form.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update all `grid-cols-2` instances to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`:

1. Row 1 (Objective & Key Result): `grid-cols-2 gap-4` -> `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`
2. Row 2 (Department & Status): `grid-cols-2 gap-4` -> `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`
3. Row 4 (Dates): `grid-cols-2 gap-4` -> `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`
4. Row 5 (Person In Charge & Accountable): `grid-cols-2 gap-4` -> `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`
5. Row 8 (Resources): `grid-cols-2 gap-4` -> `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`

Also update the date picker Button to have adequate touch target:
- Add `h-11 md:h-10` to the Button className (currently relies on default which may be too small)

The form already has proper space-y-6 for vertical spacing.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors. Check initiative form in mobile view - fields should stack vertically.
  </verify>
  <done>
Initiative form shows single-column layout on mobile, two columns on tablet+. All field pairs (Objective/Key Result, Department/Status, Dates, PIC/Accountable, Resources) stack on mobile.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Pipeline Forms Mobile Stacking</name>
  <files>src/components/pipeline/deal-form-modal.tsx, src/components/pipeline/deal-detail-sheet.tsx</files>
  <action>
**deal-form-modal.tsx:**
The form currently uses single-column layout (no grid-cols-2), which is already mobile-friendly. No changes needed for layout.

However, update DialogFooter buttons for mobile:
- Add `w-full sm:w-auto` to both Cancel and Create Deal buttons

**deal-detail-sheet.tsx:**
The form currently uses single-column layout (space-y-4 with individual fields), which is already mobile-friendly. No layout changes needed.

Update SheetFooter for mobile:
- The footer already has `flex-row justify-between sm:justify-between`
- Add `w-full sm:w-auto` to the Save Changes button to ensure it's full-width on mobile

Verify that the SheetContent now uses the responsive classes from Plan 01 (should automatically inherit `w-full md:w-3/4 md:max-w-lg`).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors. Check deal form modal and detail sheet in mobile view.
  </verify>
  <done>
Deal form modal and detail sheet are mobile-friendly with full-width buttons on mobile. Layout remains single-column which is already optimal for mobile.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Company and Contact Forms Mobile Stacking</name>
  <files>src/components/companies/company-detail-modal.tsx, src/components/companies/contact-form.tsx</files>
  <action>
**company-detail-modal.tsx:**
1. Update the company fields grid: `grid-cols-2 gap-4` -> `grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`
   (Located around line 208, contains Industry, Website, Phone, Address fields)

2. Update DialogFooter buttons:
   - Add `w-full sm:w-auto` to the Close button

The DialogContent already has `max-w-2xl max-h-[85vh] overflow-y-auto` - this will now use the responsive dialog from Plan 01.

**contact-form.tsx:**
Read the file first to check its layout. If it has grid-cols-2, update to grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2. If single-column, no changes needed.

Ensure any submit/cancel buttons have `w-full sm:w-auto` for mobile.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors. Check company detail modal in mobile view - fields should stack vertically.
  </verify>
  <done>
Company detail modal shows single-column layout on mobile for company fields. Contact form (if multi-column) stacks on mobile. Buttons are full-width on mobile.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:
1. `npm run build` passes without errors
2. Open app in Chrome DevTools mobile view (iPhone 12 Pro, 390px)
3. Open Initiative form - all field pairs should stack vertically
4. Open Deal form modal - should be full-screen, fields stack
5. Open Company detail modal - company fields should stack vertically
6. All form buttons should be full-width on mobile
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FRM-02 addressed: Form fields stack vertically on mobile
- All forms (Initiative, Deal, Company, Contact) have responsive layouts
- Buttons are touch-friendly with full-width on mobile
- Forms are usable on phone screens without horizontal scrolling
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/19-forms-modals-responsive/19-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
